# EncryptionProject
Encryption and Decryption Project built in C

Takes in a phrase that the user can input and out puts a decrypted version 

of that input. You also have the opiton to go back to the original phrase 

by chosing the decrypt option from the menu.

To run the program make sure you download both the .c file and the Makefile.

Open in any program that can run C programs (I use vim) and just run the command make

to create an exacutable file. From there a prety easy menu comes up.
